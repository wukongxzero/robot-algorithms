Hey folks, 
This repo is for robotic algorithms and to practice them using python. i will be using algorithms for robotic motion and manipulation to understand and implement them and will give a brief understanding of them to atleast what i can understand. 

algorithm 1.THE PLAN MERGING ALGORITHM.

assumptions
 1. There exists a mean which allows a robot to get the right to perform a PMO while having the guarentee that it is the only robot in the swarm of robots that is doing so..
 2. there is a mean allowing a robot (which has ob­tained the right to perform a PMO) to ask for and obtain all the other robots coordination plans.
 3. there exists a mean allowing robots to ask or in­ form one another about the occurrence of an event.
